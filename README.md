# TTreeIterator

TTreeIterator is an STL-friendly API for the [ROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root)'s [TTree](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTTree.html) class.

A description of the motivation, usage, and implementation is given [here](../../raw/main/TTreeIterator.pdf).

TTreeIterator was written by [Tim Adye](https://github.com/timadye). It is also being developed within the [RooFitTrees](https://gitlab.cern.ch/will/roofittrees/-/tree/tim) package by [Will Buttinger](https://gitlab.cern.ch/will).
